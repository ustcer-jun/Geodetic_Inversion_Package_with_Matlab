# Geodetic Inversion Package with MATLAB
Package used to do kinematic slip inversion using geodetic data.

# Data preparation
We are hoping that users have the subsampled final geodetic data products as follow:
## Subsampled InSAR phase products as follows:
Each Columns are corresponding to:
Longitude, Latitude, topography(m), Look(East_component), Look(North_component), Look(Vertical_component), Los displacement(cm/mm), Sample ration (relativate data weight,if not specified, same as 1)
